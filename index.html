  <h1>ITERABLES</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <em>Iterable objects</em> are a generalization of arrays. That’s a concept
      that allows us to make any object useable in a <code>for..of</code> loop.
    </li>
    <li>Of course, Arrays are iterable.</li>
    <li>Strings are also iterable.</li>
    <li>
      If an object isn’t technically an array, but represents a collection
      (list, set) of something, then for..of is a great syntax to loop over it,
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Symbol.iterator</h2>
  <h2>String is iterable</h2>
  <h4>Calling an iterator explicitly</h3>
    <h4>Iterables and array-likes</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Iterables are objects that implement the Symbol.iterator method, as described above.
     </li>
      <li> Array-likes are objects that have indexes and length, so they look like arrays.</li>
      <li>But an iterable may be not array-like. And vice versa an array-like may be not iterable.</li>
      <li>For instance, strings are both iterable (for..of works on them) and array-like (they have numeric indexes and length).</li>
      <li>The range in the example above is iterable, but not array-like, because it does not have indexed properties and length.</li>
      <li>Both iterables and array-likes are usually not arrays, they don’t have push, pop etc. </li>
    </ul>
